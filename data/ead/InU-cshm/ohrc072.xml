            of subjects with strong ties to and memories of Indiana University, primarily at the
            Bloomington campus, including former students, faculty, and staff, among others. The
            information spans most of the twentieth century and deals with the administrations under
            presidents Herman B Wells, John Ryan, Thomas Ehrlich, and Myles Brand. The project
            occurred in two parts. The first round of interviews was with administrators, trustees,
            and other high-ranking members of the university hierarchy. The second round of
            interviews was with senior faculty from a number of departments in the College of Arts
            and Sciences. The project is a survey of Indiana University's history as a whole
            including information about various academic departments, athletics, student
            organizations, campus growth, and the university's growth in the twentieth century. This
            project was funded by President Emeritus John Ryan.</abstract>

               is open to the use of researchers. Copies of transcript pages are available only when
               such copies are permitted by the deed of gift. Scholars must honor any restrictions
               the interviewee placed on the use of the interview. Since some of our earlier
               (pre-computer) transcripts do not exist in final form, any editing marks in a
               transcript (deletions, additions, corrections) are to be quoted as marked. Audio
               files may not be copied for patrons unless the deed of gift permits it, and a
               transcript is unavailable for that interview. The same rules of use that apply to a
               transcript apply to the audio interview. Interviews may not be reproduced in full for
               any public use, but excerpted quotes may be used as long as researchers fully cite
               the data in their research, including accession number, interview date, interviewee's

               <p>Born on February 21, 1923, William R. "Dick" Adams is a native resident of
                  Bloomington, Indiana, who earned his undergraduate degree in zoology from Indiana
                  University in 1944, his masters degree in anthropology in 1949, and joined the
                  faculty of the university in 1955 as a member of the Department of Anthropology.
                  In this interview, he discusses the town of Bloomington, his family's involvement
                  in the stone industry and banking, and his early interaction with Indiana
                  University. In addition, he discusses his various roles as game warden (police
                  officer), anthropologist, zoologist, professor, and banker. Adams speaks of racial
                  problems and crime in Bloomington as they developed in the second half of the
                  twentieth century. Finally, he details the creation of the collection which
                  comprises his bone lab, now under the care of the university.</p>

               <p>Terry Anker, an Indiana University undergraduate and School of Law alumnus,
                  discusses his memories of and involvement on campus. As a former student body
                  president, Anker recalls his many responsibilities and privileges, the people he
                  met, and the difference he made to Indiana University. In addition, he relates
                  personal anecdotes and memories of student life at the university, his life after
                  college, and of his continuing fondness and predictions for Indiana University.
                  Some topics which received emphasis were Anker's impressions of diversity, campus
                  politics, fraternities and sororities, and of the university presidents, John Ryan
                  and Thomas Ehrlich.</p>

               <p>Glenn Banks, an Indiana University alumnus from the School of Business' class of
                  1950, came to the university as a World War II navy veteran. In this interview,
                  Banks recalls his days as a student, but emphasizes the issues that the university
                  was dealing with in the nineteen nineties, including financial and budgetary
                  topics, real estate donations, the campus, and the students. A member of the

                  the university to active and dynamic figures such as Herman B Wells and William

               <p>Born in 1921, William G. Bannon is an Indiana University alumnus from the class of
                  1943 and a 1945 alumnus of the Indiana University School of Medicine. After brief

                  while maintaining an active association with Indiana University. In this
                  interview, he discusses athletics, African-American students at the university,
                  the importance of fraternities and sororities, and the economy of the state of
                  Indiana. In addition, Bannon speaks of the Indiana University board of trustees of
                  which he was a member for several years.</p>

               <p>Born on September 17, 1918, Joseph M. Black is an Indiana University alumnus from
                  the class of 1941 and a 1944 alumnus of the Indiana University School of Medicine.
                  After serving two years in the United States army, Black began a successful career
                  as a physician. In the early nineteen sixties, he was president of the alumni
                  association and has served for over twenty years on the Indiana University board
                  of trustees. Black discusses his relations with Herman B Wells and other Indiana
                  University presidents. In addition, he recalls memories of his days as a student
                  at the university including the days of World War II, the growth of the
                  university, and fraternity life.</p>

               <p>Victor Bogle was an administrator, professor, and director of the Kokomo Extension
                  Center or regional campus, as it came to be known. Bogle discusses Indiana
                  University Kokomo's evolution through the years and the changes it manifested
                  under the administrations of different Indiana University presidents, including
                  Herman B Wells, Elvis J. Stahr, and John Ryan. In addition, he speaks of the
                  relationship between the Kokomo campus and that of Indiana University in
                  Bloomington. The interview also includes information about bureaucracy and campus
                  agitation with regard to Indiana University Kokomo.</p>

               <p>Born on August 31, 1912, Robert F. Borkenstein was a member of the Indiana
                  University until 1983 and chair of what is now the Department of Criminal Justice
                  until 1970. He was one of the founders of the study of this area at Indiana
                  University. Beginning with a fledgling department entitled Police Administration,
                  he speaks of the development of the criminal justice field, alternately called
                  criminology, which included aspects of the forensic sciences, law enforcement,
                  sociology, psychology, and law. Borkenstein recalls many of the important changes
                  the field has undergone including the development of breathalizer testing, blood
                  alcohol testing, the Miranda decision, and, more recently, DNA evidence. Some of
                  the most prominent institutions in this interview are the Indiana State Police,
                  the Indiana State Police Academy, Northwestern University, Indiana University, and
                  the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

               <p>Born on October 24, 1943, John W. Brooks came to Indiana University in 1962 on a
                  track scholarship and stayed to earn his undergraduate, masters, and doctoral
                  degrees. Brooks then began his career working the Department of Financial Aid at
                  Indiana University and progressed through various positions to his current job as
                  the Director of Corporate and Foundation Relations at the university. Brooks
                  speaks of his many experiences at Indiana University as an African-American
                  including those involving racism, segregation, integration, interracial dating,
                  and the Civil Rights Movement. In addition, Brooks speaks of his involvement in
                  the fraternity, Omega Psi Chi, and the environment of the community of
                  Bloomington, Indiana. He also discusses the minority students at Indiana
                  University, the Groups program, and the development of plans for the Neal Marshall
                  Black Culture Center. He cites Herman Hudson and Jimmy Ross as two colleagues who
                  exerted much positive influence at the university.</p>

               <p>William Carmichael attended Indiana University from 1961 to 1965. After receiving
                  his BA, he went on to law school and ended up working for an accounting firm doing
                  tax work. Carmichael discusses what the university's campus was like in the
                  nineteen sixties and some of the student activism on campus. He also talks about
                  the connections he's had to Indiana University since graduation, including the
                  membership on the board of several School of Business organizations and his
                  involvement with the Indiana University Foundation.</p>

               <p>Born on March 3, 1922, Byrum E. Carter worked at Indiana University from 1947
                  until 1987 in the capacity of political science professor, assistant dean of
                  faculties, dean of the college, and chancellor of the Bloomington campus. Carter
                  discusses the impact of veterans in the student population after World War II, the
                  growth of the university and its graduate programs, and campus politics. In
                  addition, he speaks of campus controversy as exemplified by the 1969 boycott and
                  the Ballantine Lock-In. Carter recalls Indiana University under the
                  administrations of Herman B Wells, Elvis J. Stahr, and John Ryan.</p>

               <p>Born on October 25, 1932, Claus ClÃ¼ver came to Indiana University from Hamburg,
                  Germany from 1957 through 1959, and permanently in 1964, to help found the
                  Department of Comparative Literature. ClÃ¼ver served in several positions including
                  associate instructor, lecturer, associate professor, and full professor of
                  comparative literature. In addition, he helped to begin overseas studies programs
                  through Indiana University in Hamburg, Germany and in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In this
                  interview, ClÃ¼ver discusses the development and history of comparative literature
                  and his involvement in the creation of the Interarts Studies Program at Indiana
                  University. He speaks of international students at the university, racism, campus
                  changes, changes in enrollment, and some of the effects of the energy crisis on
                  the university. Finally, some of the names prominent in ClÃ¼ver's interview and in
                  the field of comparative literature are Horst Frenz, Ulrich Weisstein, Mary Ellen
                  Solt, and Clifford Flannigan.</p>

               <p>Daniel Cohen, born in 1937, speaks from his perspective as the chancellor of
                  Indiana University at South Bend about the regional campus system. He emphasizes
                  South Bend's growth as a campus center and its distinctiveness; for example, the
                  majority of Indiana University at South Bend's student body consists of
                  nontraditional students. This contributes to the uniqueness of the education and
                  student services that Indiana University at South Bend offers. In addition, Cohen
                  speaks of the effects of tuition increases on this regional campus.</p>

               <p>Born on October 11, 1912, Dorothy Collins came to Indiana University in 1939 to
                  pursue doctoral studies. Instead, she married Ralph Collins and worked in a
                  variety of capacities at the university, including work in what became the Collins
                  Living-Learning Center with her husband, the Kinsey Institute, and for several
                  Indiana University presidents. She worked especially closely with Elvis J. Stahr
                  and Herman B Wells, specifically in the capacity of ghost-writing speeches. In
                  this interview, Mrs. Collins recalls many influences on the university such as the
                  McCarthy era, university growth, the issues pertaining to minority and female
                  students, and the administration. </p>

               <p>Patrick Cross received his BA from Indiana University in 1987 and returned to
                  campus in the early nineteen nineties to obtain his JD. He was president of the
                  student body from 1986 to 1987. Cross talks about campus activism in the nineteen
                  eighties, especially issues involving South Africa. He also discusses his tenure
                  as student body president and what it was like to serve on the search committee
                  for Indiana University's new president. He finishes up by talking about his career
                  after graduation and his experiences attending law school at Indiana
                  University.</p>

               <p>Walter Joseph Daly was born in Michigan City, Indiana, in 1930. His family moved
                  to Muncie, Indiana, when he was 3. Daly attended Indiana University starting in
                  1947 and majored in zoology as a pre-medical school subject. He attended Indiana
                  University School of Medicine, did a residency, served in the army, and did
                  research before joining the Indiana University School of Medicine faculty. In
                  1970, he became chair of the department of internal medicine and dean of the
                  school in 1983. He reflects on the mission of Indiana University and its medical
                  school, the university's presidents, the cost of tuition and the cost of health
                  care.</p>

               <p>Born on December 3, 1919, Donald C. Danielson received his undergraduate degree
                  from Indiana University in 1942. After service in the United States navy and a
                  long and successful career as a businessman, and continuing involvement in alumni
                  affairs, he became a member of the Indiana University board of trustees. Danielson
                  was a trustee from 1959 until 1980 and was chair of the board of trustees for
                  eleven of those years. Danielson recalls memories of his days as a student
                  including anecdotes illustrating the empathy and spirit of Herman B Wells. In
                  addition, Danielson discusses how the administrations of Indiana University
                  presidents have differed. He also speaks of the difficult transition from
                  president Joseph Sutton to president John Ryan.</p>

               <p>Harry Day came to Indiana University in 1940 as a chemistry professor and remained
                  at Bloomington for the rest of his career. Day tells the story of the discovery of
                  Crest toothpaste. He also talks about the changes that have taken place at the
                  University since the nineteen forties, the development of the chemistry
                  department, the effects of national events, like the Civil Rights Movement, on
                  Indiana University, and the different Indiana University presidents and their
                  legacies.</p>

               <p>Clarence Doninger, born in 1935, recalls his lifelong association with Indiana
                  University: his undergraduate degree in 1957 and law degree in 1960, involvement
                  in the Men's Club, Varsity Club, athletic committee, and Alumni Association, and
                  finally his tenure as athletic director, starting in 1991. He reflects on his own
                  days as a student, changes in university in the last half of the twentieth
                  century, and the complexities of intercollegiate sports under the NCAA.</p>

               <p>Born on June 21, 1914, Oscar Dunn was a student at Indiana University from 1932
                  until he graduated in 1936, after which he began a long and successful career with
                  General Electric. Dunn relates some anecdotes of his days as a student and some
                  experiences with Herman B Wells, whom he credits with great wisdom and spirit. In
                  addition, Dunn discusses Indiana University's tremendous growth in the nineteen
                  seventies while remembering the harder days of the Great Depression. He also
                  speaks of the important actions and successes of the Indiana University
                  Foundation.</p>

               <p>Clarence Benjamin "Ben" Dutton, born on May 31, 1917, earned his undergraduate
                  degree in business administration from Indiana University in 1938 and his law
                  degree from the Indiana University School of Law in 1940. After service in the
                  United States Navy, Dutton returned to Bloomington to teach in the Indiana
                  University School of Law for a few years, after which he set up his own law
                  practice in Indianapolis. He recalls his years as a student, detailing some
                  effects of the Great Depression and issues such as housing and laundering clothes.
                  In addition, he discusses changes on the Indiana University campus, the era of
                  McCarthyism, World War II, and his relations with Herman B Wells. Dutton also
                  speaks of the efforts of the Indiana University alumni association.</p>

               <p>James Dye attended Indiana University from 1949 to 1953. After graduation he
                  served as a real estate officer in Korea and went to work in real estate and
                  construction. His university connection continued and he was appointed to the
                  board of trustees. He discusses the search for President Ehrlich, his impressions
                  of past and present presidents, the relationship between research and teaching,
                  and how Indiana University has changed over time.</p>

               <p>Don B. Earnhart attended Indiana University as an undergraduate, graduating in
                  1949. He then went to work as an accountant for the Inland Container Corporation,
                  owned by the Krannert family. The Krannerts planned to give money to Indiana
                  University after their deaths and Mr. Earnhart became the administrative trustee
                  of the Krannert Charitable Trust, which gave millions of dollars to the
                  university. Earnhart also remained directly involved in the university himself,
                  serving as director and treasurer of the Indiana University Foundation. In
                  addition to this, he discusses university funding and the changes that have taken
                  place on campus.</p>

               <p>Frank K. Edmondson earned his undergraduate degree in 1933 and his masters degree
                  in 1934 from Indiana University. After earning his Ph.D. in astronomy from
                  Harvard, he joined the Indiana University Department of Astronomy in 1937, and
                  became chairman of the department in 1944, a position he held until 1978. He
                  speaks of his academic roots at Seymour High School, his experiences at Indiana
                  University, and his use and/or association with the Lowell, Harvard, Goethe Link,
                  and Kirkwood observatories. In addition, Edmondson speaks of many of the leading
                  figures in the field of astronomy, including Henry Norris Russell and Wilber
                  Cogshall, and he discusses the development and changes undergone by the Indiana
                  University Department of Astronomy. He recalls the effects of Sputnik on this
                  field and his involvement with associations such as the National Science
                  Foundation, or NSF, and the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy,
                  or AURA. Finally, he recalls his experiences and interactions with many people at
                  Indiana University including Herman B Wells and Alfred Kinsey.</p>

               <p>Thomas Ehrlich was born in Massachusetts and attended Harvard Law School. Despite
                  his legal background, he held a variety of jobs including assistant to the
                  undersecretary of the state, president of the Legal Services Corporation, and head
                  of the Foreign Aid program. He became president of Indiana University in 1987.
                  Ehrlich discusses his presidential agenda, preference for a
                  "responsibility-centered" management style, Indiana University's Indiana
                  University regional campuses, the financial situation at the university, and the

                  School there and then went to Bloomington to attend Indiana University. He went to

               <p>Robert H. Ferrell discusses his tenure as a professor at the Indiana University
                  Department of History. He describes how his experiences as a soldier in World War
                  II made him interested in studying history. He talks about his graduate experience
                  at Yale and his mentor, Samuel Bemis. He describes the writing of his
                  dissertation, and other publications after that. He talks about people he knows in
                  the history department, and contacts with other historians in the United States.
                  He describes the importance of being a good teacher as well as a good scholar,
                  which he feels are inseparable despite the push in universities today where
                  scholarship and publishing are valued far above teaching skills. He speaks of the
                  declining quality of students since the 1960s. Finally, he speaks of the reasons
                  for his retirement. </p>

               <p>Carol Lee Finkel, nÃ©e Drevno, was born in Chicago in 1926. She lived there and in
                  Providence, Rhode Island, before coming to Indiana University in 1944. She
                  describes her student days at Indiana University including her School of Music
                  recitals, memorable classes and instructors, and post-World War II changes on
                  campus. After her 1948 graduation, Finkel continued her involvement with the
                  university through alumni association activities and the education of her four
                  children. She describes her post-graduation career as a musician and owner of a
                  wholesale automotive distribution business.</p>

               <p>Eugene D. Fletchall, born on August 19, 1908, attended Indiana University as an
                  undergraduate from 1926 to 1929 and returned a few years later to complete both
                  his undergraduate degree and his law degree, which he earned in 1934. A
                  distinguished alumnus, Fletchall recalls his days as a student at Indiana
                  University with respect to student life, Greek life, the Great Depression, and
                  athletics. In addition, he describes his relations with and anecdotes about
                  influential figures at Indiana University, including William Lowe Bryan, Ward G.
                  Biddle, Herman B Wells, and Hoagy Carmichael. Fletchall also discusses his
                  participation in Phi Gamma Delta, the student union board, and later in life, the
                  Indiana University alumni association.</p>

               <p>Christopher Gambill, born on September 30, 1957, is a 1979 Indiana University
                  alumnus and 1983 graduate of the Indiana University School of Law. In this
                  interview, he speaks extensively about his days as a student. He discusses
                  residence halls, Greek life, campus life, campus politics, and campus controversy.
                  Two examples of controversy on the Indiana University campus included the heated
                  contention surrounding draft registration and the bringing of Jane Fonda to campus
                  to speak about economic democracy. As a former student body president and married
                  student, Gambill presents a unique perspective and experience regarding the
                  previously mentioned issues and the administration of Indiana University. The
                  interview includes excerpts describing Gambill's association with many important
                  people, such as Jimmy Carter, Jane Fonda, and Gwendolyn Carter.</p>

               <p>Robert Gates attended Indiana University as an undergraduate from 1938 to 1942 and
                  then received his law degree in 1949. He began practicing law but remained
                  involved with university life, serving as a trustee for twenty-one years and as
                  president of the Union Board. Gates discusses the challenges of funding and
                  maintaining state schools, the development of programs, and the impact that the
                  nineteen sixties had on Indiana University's campus.</p>

                  teachers he had at that institution, including Rosemary Daugherty and Dee
                  Perguson. In addition, he discusses Indiana University regional campuses,
                  nontraditional students, and his time at Indiana University at Bloomington. After
                  college, Gilman went on to a long and unusually successful career in business,
                  which began when the Lazarus chain recruited him right after the completion of his
                  last degree.</p>

               <p>Born on June 3, 1960, James W. Gray is a 1982 Indiana University alumnus who also
                  graduated from the Indiana University School of Law in Indianapolis in 1985. He
                  recalls his years as a student, especially his involvement in Greek life as a
                  member of Phi Kappa Psi and his participation in campus politics. Gray discusses
                  his role as the vice president of the Indiana University Student Association and
                  his assumption of the student trusteeship on the Indiana University board of
                  trustees. He also speaks about his experiences with various Indiana University
                  courses and the issue of funding. In addition, Gray talks about the merits of
                  prominent figures in the university's history including John Ryan, Herman B Wells,
                  Dick Stoner, and George Pinnell.</p>

               <p>Born on April 13, 1937, Moses Gray attended Indiana University on a football
                  scholarship from 1957 until approximately 1961. In this interview, he discusses
                  the directions his career has taken, from being a New York Jet to a lifelong
                  career with General Motors, and his continuing involvement with Indiana
                  University. He recalls his years as a student at the university and the racism he
                  experienced as well as the exposure to academic and athletic excellence. He is
                  working in the area of fundraising to promote the development of the Neal Marshall
                  Black Culture Center at Indiana University to increase understanding among
                  students, and between students and professors. Gray also speaks fondly of Herman B
                  Wells and of his own involvement with the Indiana University Foundation.</p>

                  University, was born on April 7, 1923. In this interview, he speaks of his days
                  teaching at Earlham College and how this experience led him into active
                  involvement in the creation of Indiana University East. Grohsmeyer discusses the
                  planning and development of Indiana University East, the building and managing of
                  this regional campus, and his views on teaching versus administration. He
                  discusses the positive aspects of Indiana University East and the Indiana
                  University regional campuses, especially their attraction to nontraditional
                  students.</p>

                  University beginning in 1964. In this interview, he speaks of his experiences at

               <p>Born on November 24, 1948, Paul Helmke is a 1970 alumnus of Indiana University who
                  later attended Yale Law School. In this interview, he discusses his years as a
                  student at Indiana University and his involvement in campus politics. A former
                  student body president, he speaks of campus unrest during the late nineteen
                  sixties including protests against the Vietnam War, protests against the tuition
                  increase, and the Ballantine Lock-In. In addition, Helmke recalls campus life and
                  his involvement with Greek life and activities at Indiana University. Of special
                  interest are Helmke's stories of his friends and classmates from Yale Law School,
                  Bill and Hillary Clinton.</p>

               <p>Born on December 15, 1908, Paul G. Jasper first came to Indiana University as an
                  undergraduate in 1927 and earned his law degree in 1932. He speaks of his career
                  as a attorney and, at one time, member of the Indiana Supreme Court. In addition,
                  Jasper recalls the effects of the Great Depression on campus life. After service
                  in World War II, he was again active in the Indiana University alumni association
                  and the varsity club. He is also a member of the distinguished alumni association.
                  Jasper played varsity football and basketball during his years as a student.
                  Finally, he discusses the effects of financial difficulties at Indiana
                  University.</p>

               <p>Noble Stevenson Jennette III, born on May 20, 1953, attended Indiana University
                  from 1974 through 1978, and completed his degree in 1980. A former student body
                  president and United States Navy veteran, he was very active in campus politics
                  and social issues. Jennette recalls student protests and anger over being cut out
                  of the decision-making process at Indiana University. He speaks about the campus
                  in the nineteen seventies and some of the leaders he had contact with including
                  John Ryan, Robert O'Neil, and Steve Danzig.</p>

               <p>Steve Johnson earned a masters degree in mathematics in 1972, a masters degree in
                  computer science in 1977, and a Ph.D. in computer science in 1983, all at Indiana
                  University. In 1984, he was hired to be a computer science professor at Indiana
                  University. In this interview, Johnson speaks of the differences between the study
                  of mathematics and computer science, the development of computer science and the
                  Indiana University Department of Computer Science, and some problems that have
                  occurred with this department. In addition, he cites some people who have
                  influenced the university's Department of Computer Science including Dean Morton
                  Lowengrub, Stu Shapiro, Mitchell Wand, and others.</p>

               <p>Frank B. Jones, born on April 3, 1923, came to Indiana University as a freshman in
                  1942 and, after three and a half years of service in the United States Army during
                  World War II, returned to Indiana University to complete his undergraduate and
                  graduate degrees. He then remained at the university to work in the alumni office
                  for over forty years. In this interview, Jones speaks of his days as a student
                  with regard to World War II and campus housing. In addition, he emphasizes the
                  activities of the alumni office such as the organization of the Mini University,
                  or alumni continuing education, and alumni family camps like Shawnee Bluffs. He
                  also speaks of his association with Alice Nelson, Herman B Wells, and George
                  Heighway, among many others.</p>

               <p>Born on August 15, 1919, William Keck is a 1941 alumnus of Indiana University. He
                  served for five years in the United States military during World War II before
                  returning home to southwestern Indiana where he worked at his family's Ford car
                  dealership. Later in life, he became an active member of the Indiana University
                  Foundation. Keck speaks of his days as an Indiana University student, recalling
                  memories of his fraternity, Phi Gamma Delta, and his activities as a student
                  baseball manager. In addition, he speaks of World War II, university growth, and
                  the ROTC program at Indiana University. Some of Keck's anecdotes include his
                  friends, Dick Stoner, Claude Rich, and many others.</p>

               <p>Martha B. "Bonnie" Kendall, born on July 9, 1943, came to Indiana University in
                  1968 and went on to earn both her master's and doctoral degrees in anthropology.
                  In this interview, she speaks of her childhood with extremely conservative, racist
                  parents, a high-quality high school education in San Diego, and her eye-opening
                  undergraduate years at the ultra-conservative College of William and Mary. Kendall
                  discusses her field of anthropology and some of her negative experiences with the
                  anthropology faculty at Indiana University, both as a student and as a fellow
                  faculty member. She speaks of campus protests, effects of the Kent State
                  University Massacre, the unfairness of associate instructorships, and the teaching
                  versus research debate, especially in the context of her years teaching at Vassar
                  College. In addition, Kendall discusses the negative changes in students'
                  attitudes over the years. Some of the mentors and colleagues she speaks of are
                  Carl Voegelin and Alan Merriam.</p>

               <p>Born on June 16, 1919, Ruth Kivett-Jenson is a 1939 alumnus of Indiana University
                  who recalls her years as a student at the university in this interview. She speaks
                  of the effects of the Great Depression, discusses campus life, entertainment, such

                  and events including the Kinsey marriage classes. Later in life, she became
                  involved in the Indiana University alumni association. This pattern of active
                  participation mirrored her involvement as a student in the Association of Women
                  Students, or the AWS, of which she was the president during her senior year at the

               <p>Born on September 9, 1924, Phyllis R. Klotman joined the Indiana University
                  faculty in 1970 and served as professor and in other capacities until 1996. She
                  taught Afro-American studies, film studies, and women's studies in addition to
                  serving as Indiana University's first affirmative action officer and as dean for
                  women's affairs. Klotman also was the founder and longtime director of the Black
                  Film Center/Archive. In this interview, she discusses racism, African-Americans,
                  minority students, female faculty, anti-Semitism, and minority enrollment at
                  Indiana University. In addition, Klotman details the creation and development of
                  Afro-American studies at the university, especially in the context of the
                  Department of English.</p>

               <p>Born in 1960, Mark Kruzan is a 1982 Indiana University alumnus and former student
                  body president who discusses his years as a student in this interview. He speaks
                  of his involvement in student government and campus politics, especially through
                  the Indiana University Student Association. Some of the controversies he dealt
                  with involved tuition increase protests, funding for the Black Student Union, and
                  campus safety. After graduation and earning his law degree from Indiana
                  University, Kruzan was elected as an Indiana state representative beginning in
                  1986. He discusses the Indiana state legislature, Indiana state politics and
                  economy, and how each of these topics relates to and affects Indiana
                  University.</p>

               <p>Donald Lash received his BA from Indiana University in 1937 and then remained at
                  the university for two more years in order to get a master's degree in political
                  science. Lash was also an excellent athlete; he held the world record in the two
                  mile, was the national cross-country champion for seven years, and was a member of
                  the United States track team at the Berlin Olympics. After graduation, Lash became
                  a state police officer and then an FBI agent, specializing in firearms. Lash
                  maintained his ties with Indiana University, serving as a trustee and then
                  representing the university's interests as a state legislator. After retiring from
                  the bureau, Lash started his own real estate business. When discussing his time at
                  Indiana University, Lash mentions funding issues, the impact of the Vietnam War on
                  the university's campus, and what the campus was like during his undergraduate
                  days.</p>

               <p>Born on August 23, 1945, Guy R. Loftman is a 1967 alumnus and graduate of the
                  Indiana University School of Law. A self-proclaimed hippie, Loftman recalls his
                  days as a student at Indiana University in the turbulent nineteen sixties. Very
                  active in campus politics and student government and a former student body
                  president, he crusaded for the abolition of women's hours and was strongly against
                  the Vietnam War. Loftman speaks of racism and its appearance in Greek life and the
                  state of Indiana in the nineteen sixties. Groups such as the Ku Klux Klan,
                  Students for a Democratic Society, or SDS, and the Progressive Reform Party play
                  large roles in Loftman's characterization of the nineteen sixties in southern
                  Indiana. In addition, he speaks of the draft and his experiences as a attorney in
                  Bloomington.</p>

               <p>Born on April 17, 1917, Clarence Long is a 1939 alumnus of Indiana University. In
                  this interview, he recalls his days as a student at the university in the late
                  nineteen thirties. He discusses the events leading up to World War II and how they
                  impacted the students of Indiana University. Long also speaks of his association
                  with Herman B Wells, Otis Bowen, and Carroll Christenson. He then discusses the
                  growth and changes that Indiana University has undergone. In addition, he speaks
                  of his involvement as a member of the university board of trustees throughout most
                  of the nineteen seventies. </p>

               <p>Born in 1945, William G. Mays is a 1968 Indiana University alumnus who received
                  his MBA degree from the university in 1973. He went on to establish his own
                  multi-million dollar business. Mays speaks of his days as a student at the
                  university in the nineteen sixties and his experiences with racism, fellow
                  African-American students, and the Greek system. In addition, he recalls the
                  assassination of president John F. Kennedy, the Vietnam War, and the repercussions
                  of both. A recipient of the distinguished alumni award, Mays has been involved
                  with the Indiana University Foundation.</p>

                  University with the renowned swimming coach, Jim Counselman; with the blessing and
                  help of Herman B Wells, they built up the best swimming program of the Big Ten
                  universities. A former member of the Indiana University board of trustees,
                  McKinney discusses his thoughts on the governance, academic schools, and
                  administration of Indiana University. In addition, he speaks of his initiation of
                  architectural planning committees on the Indiana University campuses. Finally,
                  McKinney comments on his ideas as to the relationship between the American economy
                  and the future of Indiana University.</p>

               <p>Born on October 21, 1922, Thomas J. Mitchell is a 1949 alumnus of Indiana
                  University who began studying at the university in 1942. After serving three years
                  in the United States Air Force during World War II, he returned to Indiana
                  University in 1946 to complete his undergraduate degree. In this interview,
                  Mitchell discusses his days as a student at Indiana University and makes
                  comparisons to his children's experiences at the university thirty years later. In
                  addition, he speaks of the changes that Indiana University has undergone, the
                  effects of World War II, transportation, and athletics at Indiana University. He
                  also discusses his successful career as an insurance agent and how his education
                  and experiences at Indiana University helped him to achieve occupational
                  success.</p>

               <p>John Dowsley "Jack" Mulholland was born in Rochester, New York in 1927. He
                  describes his career in the corporate world, during which time he moved to
                  Evansville, Indiana. After three years there, he was recruited by Indiana
                  University to come to Bloomington. There, he held the positions of assistant vice
                  president of financial affairs and treasurer between 1972 and 1992. Mulholland
                  also taught accounting and worked with community and alumni groups. He reflects
                  upon the reputation and purpose of Indiana University and the role of higher

               <p>Born in 1938, John A. Nash is a 1960 Indiana University alumnus who went on to
                  earn his MBA from the Indiana University School of Business. After serving a year
                  and a half in the United States army, Nash went on to a long and successful career
                  in finance. In this interview, he recalls his years as a student at Indiana
                  University including campus life, minority students, and his involvement in campus
                  politics which culminated in his election to the presidency of the student body.
                  Nash speaks of his participation in the Little United Nations Assembly, or LUNA,
                  during his undergraduate years. In the years after graduation, he became involved
                  in the Indiana University alumni association and Hoosiers for Higher Education. He
                  recalls the assassination of president John F. Kennedy and cites his views of the
                  regional campus system at Indiana University. He was influenced by Byrum Carter,
                  John Mee, and Herman B Wells.</p>

               <p>Born on September 11, 1946, Charlie Nelms earned his graduate degree from Indiana
                  University in 1971 and completed his doctorate at the university in 1976. After
                  working at the Indiana University Northwest campus for several years and at
                  several other college positions in other states, Nelms returned to Indiana in 1987
                  to serve as chancellor of Indiana University East. In this interview, he speaks of
                  his years as an Indiana University student, African-American students, experiences
                  of racism, and his development of the Foster Quad Black Student Association. In
                  addition, he speaks of his work at the City University of New York, its
                  experimental open admission system, and the importance of the Indiana University
                  Indiana University regional campuses. Finally, Nelms discusses the financial
                  problems facing higher education, the teaching vs. research debate, and his
                  proposed resolutions to these problems.</p>

               <p>Born on April 25, 1940, Edward A. Nicholson discusses his work at Indiana
                  University, specifically at Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, or
                  IPFW. At IPFW, he served first as vice chancellor, and then chancellor of that
                  regional campus. In this interview, he discusses the difficulties and
                  complications that arose due to the fact that IPFW was under the joint control of
                  Indiana University and Purdue University. He speaks of the different philosophies
                  and policies of each of these universities and the implications for IPFW. In
                  addition, Nicholson discusses the strengths and many positive aspects of the Fort
                  Wayne campus and the influence of specific university presidential
                  administrations, especially that of John Ryan at Indiana University.</p>

               <p>Born on October 16, 1934, Robert M. O'Neil discusses his close early connections
                  to and similarity with Thomas Ehrlich. O'Neil eventually served as the vice
                  president of Indiana University from 1975 to 1980, and then continued into a long
                  and successful career as an administrator and law professor. In this interview,
                  O'Neil speaks of his years at Indiana University and the issues of capped
                  enrollment in the School of Business, minority students, and the continuing
                  academic strength across many disciplines at Indiana University. In addition, he
                  speaks of John Ryan and shares a few interesting stories of Herman B Wells.</p>

               <p>Danilo Orescanin completed his Master's degree at Indiana University in 1954 and
                  his doctorate in 1960 in the area of business administration. He went on to a long
                  and successful career which included both teaching and administration at the
                  university level. For example, Orescanin was assistant to the president under
                  Joseph Sutton, vice president for university relations, and many other high-level
                  administrative posts, some of which took him to four of Indiana University's
                  regional campuses. In addition, he continued to teach intermittently and, toward
                  the end of his career, focused solely on teaching in Indiana University's School
                  of Business. In this interview, Orescanin discusses his role in setting up a
                  School of Business at the University of Dacca in Bangladesh through Indiana
                  University, his philosophies of education, different Indiana University
                  presidential administrations, and campus changes.</p>

                  beginning in 1986. He speaks of other experiences in his career, including his
                  years at the University of Detroit. Rand discusses the history of Indiana
                  University Southeast, its campus, and its service to a student population
                  consisting of a majority of nontraditional students. In addition, he speaks of
                  problems associated with decreased funding, the opportunities and advantages of
                  distance education, and the Indiana University regional campuses in general.
                  Finally, he speaks of the Indiana Commission on Higher Education and its role and
                  impact in the state of Indiana.</p>

               <p>Ronald Rawald, a 1986 Indiana University alumnus, speaks of his years as a student
                  at the university. A former student body president, he became intensely involved
                  in student government and campus politics. He worked actively in the Indiana
                  University Student Association, and through this involvement, testified in the
                  Indiana General Assembly. As student body president, Rawald felt he made a
                  significant impact on the issue of the high university cost for student health
                  care with a compromise resolution he proposed, which was adopted. Rawald cites
                  Harvey C. Bunke and a class Bunke taught as major life influences.</p>

               <p>Henry H. H. Remak, born on July 27, 1916, discusses his family background and
                  youth in Germany, his education, his long association with Indiana University and
                  recalls much of the university's history from the years spanning 1936 through
                  1996. A long-time faculty member, Remak discusses his career in languages,
                  particularly German and French, and speaks of the German Department and the
                  Institute for Advanced Study. Dr. Remak comments on the beauty of the Indiana
                  University campus, the social anti-Semitism he experienced in the United States,
                  the effects of World War II on enrollment in the German Department, and German
                  Americans and culture in America. In addition, he speaks of teaching, especially
                  in the context of the Cold War, McCarthyism, and the Vietnam War and the unrest of
                  the nineteen sixties. Professor Remak shares anecdotes about two of the most
                  well-known figures in the history of Indiana University, Herman B Wells and Alfred
                  Kinsey, and he speaks of the increased and misplaced emphasis on academic
                  specialization, the teaching vs. research debate, and faculty tenure.</p>

               <p>Born on March 4, 1907, Claude Rich is a 1929 Indiana University alumnus who went
                  on to establish a career of service to the university that spanned sixty-five
                  years. Throughout these years, he held many different administrative positions
                  including assistant alumni secretary, acting director of the student union, alumni
                  secretary, which position became known as the director of alumni relations,
                  director of the sesquicentennial celebration, and director of university
                  relations. Rich comments on each of these jobs, his days as a student at Indiana
                  University, and some of his colleagues including Herman B Wells and George "Dixie"
                  Heighway. In addition, he speaks of his association with Hoagy Carmichael, the
                  Board of Aeons, and Blue Key. He discusses the impact of World War II and the
                  Vietnam War on Indiana University. Finally, Rich speaks of the university's
                  participation in the development of international higher education systems and/or
                  institutions.</p>

               <p>Born on November 30, 1950, John "Jeff" Richardson earned his undergraduate degree
                  from Indiana University in 1973, went on to Indiana University School of Law
                  immediately afterwards, received his law degree, and earned his Master's degree
                  from the School of Public and Environmental Affairs. A former student body
                  president who served from 1972 to 1973, Richardson was extensively involved in
                  campus politics, student government, and local politics and government in
                  Bloomington. Some of the issues he discusses from his years as a student are the
                  1969 tuition increase, the Vietnam War, student protests and demonstrations, the
                  Kent State University shootings, and women's rights. After completing three
                  degrees, Richardson served as a member of the city council of Bloomington and
                  later began working in Indiana state government. He recalls anecdotes involving
                  Herman B Wells, Keith Parker, John Lombardi, and John Ryan.</p>

               <p>Born on July 16, 1944, Edward Robertson, a member of the Indiana University
                  faculty since 1978, became chair of the Department of Computer Science in 1982. He
                  discusses the development of the field of computer science and the university's
                  Department of Computer Science. Robertson also speaks of the various computer
                  equipment used over the years, the decrepit state of Lindley Hall and its
                  usefulness, departmental enrollment, the small number of female faculty members,
                  and funding and its uses over the years. In addition, he recalls the time he spent
                  at the University of Ghana attempting to create a department of computer science
                  in an environment with severe limitations.</p>

               <p>Born on March 4, 1941, Alexander Schilt came to Indiana in 1970 to serve as the
                  dean of student services at Indiana University Southeast, at which time he also
                  taught one graduate class per semester. In 1976, Indiana University president John
                  Ryan appointed Schilt to the position of chancellor of Indiana University East, a
                  post at which he remained until 1980. In this interview, he discusses the changes
                  that each of these campuses have undergone, and the positive aspects of each. In
                  addition, Schilt speaks of the regional campus system at Indiana University, its
                  possible future, and his philosophies on education, specifically in relation to
                  Indiana University and its Indiana University regional campuses.</p>

               <p>Raymond Smith, born in 1917, earned his graduate degree in 1939 from the Indiana
                  University Department of Speech as part of the first class to receive a graduate
                  degree from this department. Smith speaks of the Great Depression and the
                  employment and financial constraints it inflicted. He served in the United States
                  Army Air Corps during World War II as a radio instructor, after which he completed
                  his doctorate at the University of Wisconsin in 1950. From 1950 through his
                  retirement in 1982, Smith served as a professor in Indiana University's Department
                  of Speech, later Department of Speech Communications. Smith discusses some
                  influential members of Indiana University's Department of Speech and university
                  faculty including Robert E. Barton Allen, Robert Milisen, Lee Norvell, and
                  psychology professor, Snoddy. </p>

               <p>Stephen Kendall Smith was born in Burlington, Vermont, in 1941. He moved with his
                  family to Lafayette, Indiana, in 1952. He attended Indiana University from 1960 to
                  1964, lived in the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, was actively involved in campus
                  politics, and was student body president in 1963-64. He describes many aspects of
                  campus life: fraternity life and "hell week," campus campaigns and elections,
                  social events, the presidencies of Herman B Wells and Elvis Stahr, and campus
                  reactions to the Vietnam War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Civil Rights Movement,
                  and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Smith describes his experiences as a
                  Rhodes Scholar and briefly describes his post-graduate career.</p>

                  who went on to complete his law degree at Harvard Law School in 1947 and spent
                  four years in United States military service during World War II. He discusses his

                  discusses the impact of World War II on Indiana University, and his eventual
                  return to Indiana and active involvement with the university. He has been active

                  trustees for twenty years, from 1972 to 1992. He speaks of Herman B Wells, the
                  importance of the Herman B Wells Scholars Program, the question of funding for the
                  university, and the changes the campus has undergone.</p>

               <p>Born on November 7, 1934, Jerome Strauss is a 1956 Indiana University alumnus who
                  went on to earn his law degree from the New York University School of Law.
                  Extensively involved in campus politics and student government, Strauss was first
                  elected to the student senate and then to the position of student body president.
                  He speaks of his experiences as a student, including anti-Semitism, upon citing
                  his desire for the nomination for the student body presidency. In addition, he
                  remarks on the McCarthy era and the impact of the anti-McCarthy Green Feathers
                  group on Indiana University. One of the biggest influences on Strauss at Indiana
                  University was Henry H.H. Remak. </p>

                  earning both her undergraduate and graduate degrees. Swedeen pursued a course of
                  study involving methods of team-based teaching of the arts, and she had a strong
                  background in music. She went on to earn another master's degree and her doctorate
                  from Ball State in educational administration. Later in her career, Swedeen became
                  a member of the Indiana University board of trustees and the Indiana University
                  Foundation Board. In addition, she was active in the Association of Governing
                  Boards of Universities and Colleges, or the AGB. In this interview, Swedeen
                  discusses the Indiana University School of Music, the impact of the Vietnam War on
                  the university, and the university campus.</p>

               <p>Born on April 13, 1939, Jerry Tardy came to Indiana University as an undergraduate
                  student in 1957 and ended up staying on as an employee for the majority of his
                  career. In 1971, he became the student foundation director and a few years later
                  he rose to the position of director of the alumni association. In this interview,
                  Tardy discusses the activities of the alumni association, Hoosiers for Higher
                  Education, and the Indiana University Foundation, especially in the face of
                  budgetary constraints of the past few decades. He also speaks of the Little 500
                  and the making of <emph render="underline">Breaking Away</emph>, a movie about the
                  Little 500. Tardy describes his relationships with Bob Knight, John Ryan, Joseph

               <p>Born on April 1, 1922, Charles Van Tassel earned his medical degree from the
                  Indiana University School of Medicine in Bloomington in 1946. In this interview,
                  he recalls his years as a student at Indiana University, the impact of World War
                  II on the university, and the changes the campus has undergone in the intervening
                  years. Van Tassel speaks of his continuing involvement with Indiana University
                  including his active participation in the varsity club and the Indiana University
                  Foundation Board, and his interest in university athletics. In addition, he
                  discusses the Twelfth Man Club, the problems posed by funding, and the School of
                  Medicine in Bloomington.</p>

               <p>Cecilia Hendricks Wahl, a 1938 Indiana University alumnus, returned to Bloomington
                  in 1953 when she and her husband became employees of the university. In this
                  interview, Wahl describes her coming of age in the town of Bloomington, her mother
                  and aunt's faculty positions at the university, her undergraduate years, and
                  interest and involvement in the Department of Speech, specifically the theater
                  aspect of this department. She speaks of the impact of the Great Depression and
                  World War II on her life and her jobs, including radio station manager and
                  secretary to the Indiana University board of trustees. In addition, Wahl recalls
                  her participation in the Association of Women Students, or AWS, and, later in
                  life, the Bloomington Hospital, and the Annuitants. She speaks of the changes
                  manifested by fraternities and sororities over the years and the rapid changes of
                  the turbulent sixties. Finally, she fondly recalls members of the Indiana
                  University Department of Speech, including Lee Norvelle and Bill Kinzer.</p>

               <p>Born in 1950, John Walda is a 1972 Indiana University alumnus who went on to
                  receive his graduate degree from the Indiana University School of Law in 1975.
                  Very involved in student activities, Walda was president of his undergraduate
                  class for two years and an active participator in student protests against the
                  Vietnam War. Walda speaks of the anti-war climate on campus during the early
                  nineteen seventies and the unrest and protests generated by tuition hikes and the
                  Civil Rights Movement, including the Ballantine Lock-In and the effects of the
                  Kent State shootings. He also speaks of the financial problems Indiana University
                  is facing, his participation on the board of trustees, and the status and growth
                  of the IUPUI campus.</p>

               <p>Born in 1913, Lawrence Leslie Waters joined the faculty of Indiana University in
                  the School of Business in 1948 and served as a professor until 1979. Throughout
                  this period, Waters also continued to play an active role in the world of business
                  and he gave innumerable talks throughout the world, as well as writing many
                  articles. In this interview, he speaks of the effects of the Great Depression,
                  stories of his former students, the McCarthy era, the teaching versus research
                  debate, and some of the major events of his long and successful career as a
                  businessman and as a professor. In addition, Waters discusses the Indiana
                  University School of Business and his role in the development of several
                  organizations, including the Mid-West Business Administration Association, or the

               <p>Born on February 17, 1928, James Weigand came to Indiana University in 1962 to
                  complete his doctoral degree in the area of science education. After earning his
                  Ph.D., he joined the faculty and became chair of the fledgling and developing
                  Department of Science Education in 1965. In this interview, Weigand discusses the
                  development of the field and department of science education, his education
                  philosophy, dress codes, and the teaching versus research debate. In addition, he
                  recalls the racism, integration, and African-American doctoral students of the
                  past few decades. Weigand also discusses Herman B Wells and relates some stories
                  about the former president.</p>

               <p>Born on February 3, 1920, Howard S. "Howdy" Wilcox came to Indiana University as
                  an undergraduate in 1938. After receiving his undergraduate degree, he served in
                  the United States army until 1947. Wilcox opened his own public relations firm and
                  was contacted by Indiana University in this capacity. His connections with Indiana
                  University became increasingly tight as he became the executive director of the
                  Indiana University Foundation and a long-standing member of the Indiana University
                  board of trustees. In addition, Wilcox had the brainchild that resulted in the
                  creation of the Little 500 and the scholarships it funds. He also speaks of his
                  student days including his involvement with the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity and the
                  Sphinx Club. Wilcox discusses his association with many influential figures
                  including Herman B Wells, Elvis J. Stahr, Joseph Sutton, E. Ross Bartley, and
                  Colonel Raymond L. Shoemaker.</p>

               <p>Born in 1915, York Willbern joined the Indiana University faculty as a full
                  professor in the department of political science in 1957. In this interview, he
                  discusses his years at Indiana University, the administration under different
                  Indiana University presidencies, and the impact of different phenomena on
                  education in general and Indiana University specifically. These phenomena include
                  World War II and the Cold War. Willbern also speaks of some of the controversies
                  he has experienced at the university such as those involving faculty tenure,
                  teaching versus research, and the regional campus system. In addition, he
                  discusses the creation of the School of Public and Environmental Affairs, or SPEA,
                  his involvement with it, and the IUPUI campus.</p>

               <p>Born in 1922, Edgar Williams came to Indiana University in 1947, completed his
                  master's degree through the Department of Management in 1948, and subsequently
                  joined the Indiana University faculty. Thus began a career that spanned forty-five
                  years at Indiana University and included both academic duties and administrative
                  duties, including teaching, and serving as the vice president for administration
                  and the assistant director of the athletic department, among many other positions.
                  Williams discusses the influx of veterans into Indiana University after World War
                  II, the development of the Indiana University regional campuses, the status of
                  IUPUI, the university faculty, and the financial and/or budgetary problems the
                  university is experiencing. In addition, he speaks of the administrations of
                  different Indiana University presidents from Herman B Wells to Thomas Ehrlich.</p>

               <p>Born on August 7, 1955, James Wolfe is an Indiana University alumni from the class
                  of 1977 who went on to earn his law degree from the Indiana University School of
                  Law in 1981. In addition, he was involved in campus politics, becoming a student
                  trustee from 1977 through 1979. In this interview, Wolfe discusses university
                  organization, the Indiana University School of Business, and the Indiana
                  University School of Law. He speaks of the differences between various university
                  presidential administrations, including that of John Ryan. Wolfe describes some of
                  his major influences, especially Claus ClÃ¼ver and Bill Haeberle, and his years
                  working for J. Danforth Quayle.</p>
